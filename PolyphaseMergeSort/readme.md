# Polyphase Merge Sort 

Uses Fibonacci numbers
The initial distribution of runs in the work files must conform to a sequence of Fibonacci numbers. [2]
Decreases the number of runs
At each iteration, the polyphase merge sort merges runs into larger runs, decreasing the number of runs. [1]
Uses file streams
The polyphase merge sort uses file streams to sort and merge files that can't be loaded into the computer's main memory. [3]
