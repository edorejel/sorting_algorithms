# Bogo Sort

An example of bogo sort is sorting a deck of cards by throwing it into the air, randomly picking up the cards, and repeating until the deck is in order. [1, 2]

Bogo sort, also known as permutation sort, is an algorithm that generates and tests permutations of its input until it finds a sorted one. It's considered an ineffective algorithm and is a canonical example of awfulness. [1, 2, 3]

Here are some other examples of bogo sort: [4]
Shaking a box
Put all the items in a box, shake it, and randomly pick an item out. If the item isn't what you want, put all the items back in the box, shuffle them again, and start counting the values from the beginning. [4]
PHP
The bogo_sort() function randomly shuffles a list until it's sorted. It calls the shuffle() function to rearrange the list, then checks if it's sorted using the issorted() function. [5]

Bogo sort is interesting to learn in theory, but it's not a useful or effective sorting algorithm. [6]
