# Salt and Pepper Sort

A "salt and pepper" sort, gives you an even spacing between elements, regardless of the size of the elements being sorted. That is, it gives you a even number of "salt and pepper on your plate" regardless of how much salt or pepper you originally started with. 
Ideal when two or more different objects are used to sort, and you want an even distribution after processing both sets of objects in the same program.


Maybe "Shaker Sort" is a closely related sorting algorithm.
