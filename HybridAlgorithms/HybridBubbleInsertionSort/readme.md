# Insertion Sort Bubble Sort Hybrid

## 1. Bubble Sort with Early Exit (Hybrid with Bubble Sort)
This version introduces elements of Insertion Sort by recognizing sorted portions early:

## Key Idea:
Use Bubble Sort's swapping technique but track if any swaps occur during a full pass.
If no swaps occur, the array is already sorted, and you can exit early.

## 2. Binary-Insertion Bubble Sort (Hybrid with Insertion Sort)
This version incorporates binary search to improve insertion placement while also iteratively bubbling up unsorted elements.

## Key Idea:
Bubble up the smallest element, then use Binary Insertion Sort for inserting it in the right place in subsequent passes.

## Applications and Performance
These hybrids balance stability and performance, often suited for nearly sorted or small arrays.
Hybrid sorts like TimSort use a combination of sorting methods (Merge Sort + Insertion Sort), but combining Bubble Sort's simplicity with Insertion Sortâ€™s direct insertion offers a unique trade-off.
